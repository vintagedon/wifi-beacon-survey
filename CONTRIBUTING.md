## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Follow the documentation standards in `docs/documentation-standards/`.
3. Include YAML frontmatter on any new Markdown files (see `docs/documentation-standards/tagging-strategy.md`).
4. Add interior READMEs to any new directories.
5. Use the appropriate script header template for new scripts.
6. Write clear commit messages (present tense, imperative mood, 72-char first line).
7. Install dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
8. Keep captures, identifier-bearing derived outputs, and private working context outside the repository; see `AGENTS.md` for the storage boundary.
9. Update relevant documentation if your change affects it.
10. Submit your pull request with a clear description of the changes.

## Documentation Standards

This project uses RAG-optimized documentation with YAML frontmatter. Before contributing documentation, review:

- [Tagging Strategy](docs/documentation-standards/tagging-strategy.md) — controlled vocabulary for tags
- [Code Commenting](docs/documentation-standards/code-commenting-dual-audience.md) — dual-audience commenting for humans and AI agents
- Template selection guide in [Documentation Standards README](docs/documentation-standards/README.md)

## Style Guidelines

- Follow existing patterns — match the style of surrounding files
- Keep documentation lean — don't pad sections for completeness
- Use semantic numbering and preserve gaps if sections are omitted
